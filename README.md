## Overview

This application is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Password Generator

The password generator creates passwords with different formats, which can be used for various purposes such as checking regex patterns or generating secret keys.

### Part 2: Hashword Attack Implementation

In this section, we explore two methods of password cracking:

- **Dictionary Attack:** It uses dictionaries to find a word that matches the given hash.

- **Brute Force Attack:** The application tries all possible combinations of characters to find the hashed word in plain text.
